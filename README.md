# Multi-Stage Two-Tower Recommender
A multi-stage movie recommendation system using YouTube's Tow-Tower architecture.

## Getting Started
### Installation
To set up the virtual environment and install the necessary dependencies, run the following command:
```bash
make install
```
This will ensure your environment is prepared with all required packages, ready to run the project.

### Usage
...
Once the environment is set up, you can start using the recommender system for tasks like training, evaluation, or inference.

## Dataset
Different versions of the [MovieLens](https://grouplens.org/datasets/movielens/) dataset are used for both training and evaluation purposes. Due to significant data redundancy in the original datasets, I created the notebook [_dataset_maker.ipynb](_dataset_maker.ipynb) to generate separate files for movies, users, and ratings, effectively eliminating duplication and reducing the overal size of each datasets along side feature engineering and feature selection for the task.

### Feature Selection
- Retained all features from the original dataset, except for `raw_user_age`, which is only available in the `100k` version of the dataset.
- Removed `user_occupation_text` since `user_occupation_label` was derived from it, making it redundant.

### Feature Engineering
- Most of the `movie_title` values in the dataset include their release years in parentheses, which were extracted and treated as a separate feature. For movies without a listed release year, the corresponding values are left as `NaN`.
- Converted the `user_gender` feature from boolean values to integer representations.
